  ## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This application generates a webpage that displays a team's basic info so that quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles is possible. It also provides a unit test for every part of the code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing is also provided.
